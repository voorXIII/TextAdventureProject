# TextAdventureProject
Repository for my text adventure project for a school project.

This was coded all in Python.

This is a basic text adventure game, which consists of 3 fights. Each time you win a fight, your character will recieve a little boost to their stats.

Nothing special is required to run it, just a Python interpreter like PyCharm.
