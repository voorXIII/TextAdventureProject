# TextAdventureProject
Repository for my text adventure project for a school project.

This was coded all in Python 3.7 and will need that to work properly.

This is a basic text adventure game, which consists of 3 fights. Each time you win a fight, your character will recieve a little boost to their stats. If you die, you will have the option to play again, if you win you can also choose to play again.

Nothing special is required to run it, just a Python interpreter like PyCharm and Python 3.7
